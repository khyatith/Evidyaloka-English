# Evidyaloka-English

Recently I have started volunteering for a non-profit in India that deals with teaching village kids some basic Maths, Science and English.

While teaching kids English phonetics, I realized that there is no good online games that I can use to make the classes more interesting.

This project is aimed at targeting that issue.

Right now I am using create-react-app for this , but maybe later I will change to something more stable.
